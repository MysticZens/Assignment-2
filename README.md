# Assignment 2 - Minigame Practice (FPS)
This website is created for people who mostly plays First-Person Shooter games. First-Person Shooter (FPS) games requires skills such as aiming with the mouse, the number of clicks per second, precision aiming, and also the reaction time of the player. This website is kind of like a minigame for all 4 requirements to practice and improve on their skill. 

Furthermore, leaderboards are shown and the top 10 players with the highscore for each game will be displayed. If a player reaches a leaderboard, he can be considered as one of the best players out of all of the players. 

## Design Process
When we decided to make this website, this website is for gamers, specifically those players who play First-Person Shooter games such as Valorant, CS:GO, Overwatch, APEX Legends, Call of Duty, and Paladins. Since the website consists of practices that trains their FPS gaming skills, it is suitable for those avid gamers.

- As a player who desires to improve their skills, we hope players get to improve their skills and aim to reach the leaderboards.
- As a player who wants to try out new FPS games, this is a good start for training their FPS gaming skills and experience how FPS feels like.
- As a regular player who does not play games, it is convenient for them to visit the website to play without having to download any content to their desktop.
